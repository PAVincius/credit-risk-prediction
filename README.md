## Predicting Credit Risk with AWS

### Overview

This repository outlines the steps involved in building a credit risk prediction model using AWS. The process includes data collection, preparation, exploration, model building, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.

### Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- Basic knowledge of Python and machine learning
- Familiarity with AWS services like S3, Redshift, Glue, SageMaker, QuickSight, and CloudWatch

### Steps

#### 1 - Data Collection and Preparation

Data sources:
- Historical credit data (score, payments, debt, etc.)
- Demographic data (age, income, occupation, etc.)
- Behavioral data (purchase history, card usage patterns, etc.)

Storage:
- Amazon S3: For storing large volumes of raw data.
- Amazon Redshift: For storing and querying structured data efficiently.

Preparation:
- AWS Glue: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Amazon Athena: For querying data stored in S3 using SQL.
- Amazon SageMaker: For data preparation tasks like cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.

#### 2 - Data Exploration and Analysis

- Amazon QuickSight: For visualizing and exploring data, identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers.
- Amazon SageMaker: For statistical analysis and interactive visualizations.

#### 3 - Model Building

Amazon SageMaker:
- Algorithms: Choose suitable algorithms for classification (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Training: Train the model using prepared data.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.

Amazon SageMaker Autopilot: For automating algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization.

#### 4 - Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC curve

Amazon SageMaker: For calculating and visualizing evaluation metrics.

#### 5 - Model Deployment

Amazon SageMaker:
- Endpoint: For serving the model in real-time, allowing predictions for new data.
- Batch Transform: For processing large volumes of data asynchronously.

#### 6 - Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring model performance in production.
- Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor: For detecting data drift and retraining the model as needed.
