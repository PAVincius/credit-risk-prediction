# Pipeline review

This Pipeline consists of(but not limited to), data collection, preparation, exploration, model building, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.
 
<Steps>

### Step 1: Data Collection and Preparation
 
#### Data sources:
- Historical credit data (score, payments, debt, etc.)
- Demographic data (age, income, occupation, etc.)
- Behavioral data (purchase history, card usage patterns, etc.)
- Alternative data (social media, mobile device data, etc.)

#### Storage:
- Amazon S3: For storing large volumes of raw data.
- Amazon Redshift: For storing and querying structured data efficiently.

#### Preparation:
- AWS Glue: For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
- Amazon Athena: For querying data stored in S3 using SQL.
- Amazon SageMaker: For data preparation tasks like cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
 
### Step 2: Data Exploration and Analysis
 
- Amazon QuickSight: For visualizing and exploring data, identifying patterns, correlations, and outliers.
- Amazon SageMaker: For statistical analysis and interactive visualizations.

### Step 3: Model Building

#### Amazon SageMaker:
- Algorithms: Choose suitable algorithms for classification (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks).
- Training: Train the model using prepared data.
- Hyperparameter tuning: Optimize model performance by adjusting hyperparameters.

#### Amazon SageMaker Autopilot:
  For automating algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation

##### Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC curve

#### Amazon SageMaker:

- Endpoint: For serving the model in real-time, allowing predictions for new data.
- Batch Transform: For processing large volumes of data asynchronously.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring model performance in production.
- Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor: For detecting data drift and retraining the model as needed.

### Step 6: Monitoring and Continuous Improvement

- Amazon CloudWatch: For monitoring model performance in production.
- Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor: For detecting data drift and retraining the model as needed.
